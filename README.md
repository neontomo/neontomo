# Tomo Myrman

I'm Tomo Myrman, a software developer consultant based in Stockholm and my drive is to build products from idea to completion. I started coding when I was 10 and been obsessed ever since.

With over a decade of coding experience, I've adopted a range of languages and technologies, from JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, jQuery, Python, to more modern tools like React, Tailwind, TypeScript, GraphQL/MongoDB, Node/Express, Next.js/Remix, and more. Comfortable in Mac, Windows and Linux environments and able to configure servers and DNS records.

I'm deeply passionate about technology, always hungry to learn and adapt quickly. Beyond coding, my early background in event management and the hospitality industry equips me with strong communication and teamwork skills. My first instinct is to ask diagnostic or open questions to understand a domain, problem or client better; only then will I give solutions or develop them with research and trial and error. I love feedback and work well with teams.

Oh, and I love Seinfeld.
