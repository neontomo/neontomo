# Tomo Myrman

I'm Tomo Myrman, a software developer consultant based in Stockholm, with prior experience at Apple as an AI annotation analyst. Recently graduated from Hyper Island in AI and Business, my drive is to build products from idea to completion.

With over a decade of coding experience, I've adopted a range of languages and technologies, from JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, jQuery, Python, to more modern tools like React, Tailwind, TypeScript, GraphQL/MongoDB, Node/Express, Next.js/Remix, and more. Comfortable in Mac, Windows and Linux environments and able to configure servers and DNS records.

I'm deeply passionate about technology, always hungry to learn and adapt quickly. Beyond coding, my early background in event management and the hospitality industry equips me with strong communication and teamwork skills. My first instinct is to ask diagnostic or open questions to understand a domain, problem or client better; only then will I give solutions or develop them with research and trial and error.

When you hire me as a developer and consultant, you're not just getting a technical guy – you're dealing with someone who owns projects and has his heart connected to problem-solving. Oh, and I love Seinfeld.
