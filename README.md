# Tomo Myrman

hi, I'm Tomo, and I love ideating, building and shipping products.

I started coding at 10 years old and was bitten by the problem-solving bug. I'm ambitious and think creatively - two traits that help me move fast and learn new ideas.

I've adopted a range of fullstack technologies, but mainly live in NextJS/TypeScript land these days. I work best with highly motivated teams who communicate openly.

oh, and I'm obsessed with Twin Peaks and Seinfeld. let's connect!
