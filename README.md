# Tomo Myrman

Hi, I'm Tomo, a software developer and consultant, and my drive is to build products from idea to completion. I started coding at 10 and been obsessed ever since. I have a burning ambition in me and I'm able to prioritise effectively - two traits that help me move fast and ship excellent code.

With over a decade of coding experience, I've adopted a range of languages and technologies, from JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, jQuery, Python, to more modern tools like React, Tailwind, TypeScript, GraphQL, MongoDB, Node/Express, Next.js/Remix, and more. I have skills in Linux, Mac and servers in general.

I'm deeply passionate about technology, always hungry to learn and adapt quickly. Beyond coding, my early background in event management and the hospitality industry equips me with strong communication and teamwork skills. My first instinct is to ask diagnostic and open questions to understand a domain, problem or client better; only then will I give solutions or develop them with research and trial and error. I love feedback and work best with highly motivated teams.

Oh, and I love Seinfeld. Let's connect!
